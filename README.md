LagerLogger
===========

A [lager](https://github.com/basho/lager) backend that forwards all log messages to Elixir's [Logger](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/logger/).

Built by [PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com) because [exometer](https://github.com/feuerlabs/exometer) has a hard dependency on lager.
